Their multiplication\\ncalculates the total magic level. If the result equals one of the levels described in the table above, you craft the\\npresent and remove both materials and magic value. Otherwise:\\n    . If the product of the operation is a negative number, you should sum the values together, remove them both from their positions, and add the result to the materials.\\n    . If the product doesn\\'t equal one of the magic levels in the table and is a positive number, remove only the magic value and increase the material value by 15.\\n    . If the magic or material (or both) equals 0, remove it (or both) and continue crafting the presents.\\n\\nStop crafting presents when you run out of boxes of materials or magic level values.\\n\\nYour task is considered done if you manage to craft either one of the pairs:\\n· a doll and a train\\n. a teddy bear and a bicycle\\n\\nInput\\n\\n    .
